During the Fall semester of my sophomore year, our final project for ICS 314 was to create a Web Application with a team. My team decided to make a website that helps UH Manoa students find study spots around campus.

"As college students, we share the struggle of finding a nice spot to study, hangout, relax, or meet new people. In addition, some unicorn places heard about from a friend of a friend are hard to find and might not even be worth the effort and time to get there. We will create a guide to spots on and around campus including a map, descriptions, photos, amenities, a rating system based on quietness, crowd levels, social opportunities, etc. Students can easily find, add, and rate spots, fostering a community of interaction and academic success."
