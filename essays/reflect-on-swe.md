## Developing a Skill
In ICS 314, we learned a lot about software engineering, specifically web development. But along with this, we implemented various skills and techniques that would be essential in aiding us to create the most functional and utilitarian programs, not just for others, but for ourselves and our teams. We tend to overlook the simple concepts, but skills like **Coding Standards** and **Ethics in Software Engineering** were essential to my learning and are just a couple parts of Software Engineering that I'll take with me beyond ICS 314. 
## Coding Standards
Coding Standards are a pretty simple thing that we as Computer Science students, or Software Developers, learn from the get-go. I'll always count on my professors to give us some type of mini lecture on the importance of them and what not on the first week of classes. It seems a bit repetitive and boring, but you really start to see the importance of them after completing your own web app. 

A general definition of coding standards is maintaining structured, well-defined, and standardized style of coding. You can make your own general Coding Standards for yourself, but also for an organization or group. These standards include naming conventions, code formatting, and error handling.

Especially when working in groups, you really start to see the importance of following Coding Standards. Working independently may give you the freedom to be all over the place, but that definitely doesn't fly in a group. There could be multiple people working on the same file, and having unorganized code is just a means for disaster. Setting the standards and following them is the least one can do to ensure everyone is on a similar page.
