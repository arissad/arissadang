## Design Patterns - What's the Issue?

As an aspiring software developer, over the course of 314, I’ve discovered the hard way that there's an infinite amount of issues you can run into while making and maintaining an app. But thankfully, for every problem, there’s a solution. This is where design patterns come in. Design Patterns don’t only help to simplify and expand code, but will also save you time and reduce bugs and errors to aid you in the long run. 

## My Steps for Implementing Design Patterns

To be completely honest, I haven't utilized Design Patterns to their fullest potential, much less more than once or twice. It's still a relatively new concept to me and we haven't talked about them in class, so I don't find myself thinking about it when writing code. 

## Search Before You Ask

On the other hand, this question asked, [“Validate an email address whether it is valid or invalid based on condition”](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78980085/validate-an-email-address-whether-it-is-valid-or-invalid-based-on-condition). This question provided their code, however, it’s unclear what they’re really asking. You can tell it’s not detailed enough by the comments, as they’re asking for clarification on what the asker is trying to do, and are confused about the inquiry. Also, the asker didn’t search first as the question had already been asked before in StackOverflow 15 years ago. The confusion could’ve been avoided if they made a search for the question before asking it.

## Conclusion

Overall, being aware of how you ask certain questions is an underrated but extremely important skill one needs to become a successful software engineer. Knowing exactly what you’re asking and who you’re asking can not only help you get the assistance you need, but can also help any people who want to help you get the answers in the first place.
